# Berry Platform — DX Terminal & Movement Engine

The Berry Platform is a modular, chain‑aware monitoring and movement engine designed to track blockchain activity, certify artefacts, and maintain a living operational heartbeat across the ecosystem.

It blends traditional system monitoring with cultural lineage: every artefact, cert, and heartbeat becomes part of a movement‑grade audit trail.

This repository contains the full DX Terminal node architecture, orchestrator, scheduler, and movement logic that powers the platform.

## 🚀 What Is the DX Terminal?

The DX Terminal is a **node‑driven monitoring engine**.  
Each node is a self‑contained subsystem that performs a specific task:

- Metrics (RPC latency, block height, gas price)
- Scanner (contract state, wallet balance, event logs)
- DEX (liquidity, swaps, price ratios)
- Cert (SHA‑256 hashing, integrity checks, ledger updates)
- Heartbeat (engine, contract, wallet reachability)
- Orchestrator (global system summary)
- Movement (relic lineage, artefact count, platform health)

Nodes run on a scheduler, produce timestamped JSON artefacts, and feed into a global summary used by dashboards and internal tooling.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

******************************************************8
Absolutely, Jordan — here comes the top‑level project README.  
This is the one that sits at the root of the Berry Platform repo and tells the world:

- what this project is  
- why it exists  
- how it works  
- what makes it different  
- how to run it  
- how to contribute  

It’s written in a clean, professional, open‑source tone — but still carries your mythic fingerprint.

🧩 Architecture Overview

`
Registry → Scheduler → Executor → Node Handlers → Artefacts → Certs → Orchestrator → Movement Engine
`

Registry
Defines all nodes, schedules, metadata, and chain configuration.

Scheduler
Runs nodes on cron‑style intervals.

Executor
Routes each node to the correct handler and writes JSON outputs.

Node Handlers
Each subsystem has its own handler:
- metricsNode.js
- scannerNode.js
- dexNode.js
- certNode.js
- heartbeatNode.js
- orchestratorNode.js
- movementNode.js

Artefacts
Every node writes timestamped JSON files into /output.

Cert Ledger
Cert nodes hash artefacts and append entries to /certs/cert-ledger.json.

Orchestrator Summary
Aggregates all node outputs into a global health snapshot.

Movement Engine
Interprets artefacts + certs to determine platform vitality.

🛠 Getting Started

Install dependencies
`
npm install
`

Run the scheduler
`
node scheduler.js
`

View artefacts
Check the /output folder for JSON files generated by each node.

View cert lineage
Check /certs/cert-ledger.json for SHA‑256 hashes and integrity history.

🧬 Movement Philosophy

The Berry Platform treats infrastructure as culture.

- Every artefact is a timestamp  
- Every cert is a proof  
- Every heartbeat is a signal  
- Every node is a ritual  

The DX Terminal is not just a monitoring tool — it is a living ledger of the platform’s operational and mythic history.
