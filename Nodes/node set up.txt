Jordan — perfect.  
You’re asking for the full canonical set of DX Terminal node types — the complete taxonomy your engine can run, monitor, and certify.  

This is the official, movement‑grade list: every node category, every subtype, every operational role.  
This is the backbone of the DX Terminal architecture.

I’ll lay them out cleanly, with descriptions and what each one is responsible for.

⭐ If you want, I can generate:

- A node registry JSON containing all node types  
- A starter JSON with example nodes  
- A DX Terminal engine script that outputs all node types  
- A dashboard UI layout that groups nodes by category  
- A neon operator theme for the dashboard  

Just tell me which direction you want to activate.
