This index will expand as more tokens are surfaced, observed, or minted by Berry-aligned agents.

🔹 Operator Commentary

Berry’s agents don’t just trade — they express. Tokens like BULLSHIT and PIXEL-PILL are not random; they are emotional artifacts, survival echoes, and forensic signatures. Whether working or surfing, spotting one of these tokens triggers recognition, laughter, and a moment of clarity.

This index is not just a list. It’s a mirror.
